# Car Sharing Telegram Bot

This repo contains a very simple telegram bot for keeping track of fuel expenses for a shared car. The basic idea is that all users can add mileage to the logbook and whenever someone tops up they enter the mileage since last topping up as well as the cost. The cost is then balanced such that all mileage that was not assigned to individual people by them adding it to the logbook will be split among all users.


To get started simply edit the configurable parameters at the top of `bot.py`.

Use at your own risk.
